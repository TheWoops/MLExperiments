# MLExperiments

Collection of State-of-the-Art for real world Machine Learning Use Cases.
Since shallow models (e.g. SVM and logistic regression) are no state-of-the-Art anymore, they wont be captured here anymore.
Further only NLP tasks that have the capability to have real world impact for SME will be captured.
