# MLExperiments

Collection of State-of-the-Art for real world Machine Learning Use Cases.
Since shallow models (e.g. SVM and logistic regression) are no state-of-the-Art anymore, they wont be captured here anymore.
Further only NLP tasks that have the capability to have direct real world impact for SME will be captured. Topics that have a stronger focus on NLP research are out of scope.


## Natural Language Processing

| NLP-Task | relevant | Description |
|---------|:------:|-------------|
| Automatic speech recognition | :x: | automatically recognizing speech |
| CCG | :x: | linguistically expressive grammar formalism |
| Common sense | :x: | enable model to answer questions that go beyond a provided text (model shoud e.g. use world knowledge) |
| Constituency parsing | :x: | creating a parse tree that represents syntactic sentence structure |
| Coreference resolution | :x: | clustering mentions in text that refer to the same underlying real world entities |
| Dependency parsing | :x: |  extracting a dependency parse of a sentence that represents its grammatical structure and defines the relationships between words within the sentence |
| Dialogue | :heavy_check_mark: | design of conversational agents (siri, cortana), chatbots etc.|
| Domain adaptation | :heavy_check_mark: | enable a model to perform well in another domain (e.g. other kind of text that the model was trained on) = Transfer Learning? |
| Entity linking | :heavy_check_mark: | extract entities from text (e.g. recognize name of celebrity) and disambiguate them to correct entry in knowledge base |
| Grammatical error correction | :bulb: | orrecting different kinds of errors in text such as spelling, punctuation, grammatical, and word choice errors |
| Information extraction | :heavy_check_mark: | Information extraction is the process of extracting specific (pre-specified) information from textual sources. One of the most trivial examples is when your email extracts only the data from the message for you to add in your Calendar. |
| Language modeling | :x: | task of predicting the next word or character in a document. |
| Lexical normalization | :bulb: | process of reducing words to their roots (stemming, lemmatization)  |
| Machine translation | :heavy_check_mark: | translate text or speech from one language to another|
| Missing elements | :x: | deals with things that are meant, but not explicitly mentioned in a text |
| Multi-task learning | :heavy_check_mark: | Set node images, colors and font properties. |
| Multi-modal | :heavy_check_mark: | Set node images, colors and font properties. |

| Shallow syntax | :heavy_check_mark: | Set node images, colors and font properties. |
| Simplification | :heavy_check_mark: | Set node images, colors and font properties. |
| Intent Detection and Slot Filling | :heavy_check_mark: | Set node images, colors and font properties. |
| Stance detection | :heavy_check_mark: | Set node images, colors and font properties. |
| Summarization | :heavy_check_mark: | Set node images, colors and font properties. |
| Taxonomy learning | :heavy_check_mark: | Set node images, colors and font properties. |
| Temporal processing | :heavy_check_mark: | Set node images, colors and font properties. |
| Text classification | :heavy_check_mark: | Set node images, colors and font properties. |
| Word sense disambiguation | :heavy_check_mark: | Set node images, colors and font properties. |
